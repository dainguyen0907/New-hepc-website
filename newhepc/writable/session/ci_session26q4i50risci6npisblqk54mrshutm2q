Data is defined as individual facts, while information is the organization and interpretation of those facts. If data are the bricks, then information is the house they form when laid out in an organized manner.  
";s:12:"content_post";s:1935:"<h1>&nbsp;</h1><h2><strong>What Is Data?</strong></h2><p>Data is defined as a collection of individual facts or statistics. (While “datum” is technically the singular form of “data,” it’s not commonly used in everyday language.) Data can come in the form of text, observations, figures, images, numbers, graphs, or symbols. For example, data might include individual prices, weights, addresses, ages, names, temperatures, dates, or distances.</p><p>Data is a raw form of knowledge and, on its own, doesn’t carry any significance or purpose. In other words, you have to interpret data for it to have meaning. Data can be simple—and may even seem useless until it is analyzed, organized, and interpreted.</p><p>There are two main types of data:</p><ul><li><strong>Quantitative data</strong> is provided in numerical form, like the weight, volume, or cost of an item.</li><li><strong>Qualitative data</strong> is descriptive, but non-numerical, like the name, sex, or eye color of a person.</li></ul><h2><strong>What Is Information?</strong></h2><p>Information is defined as knowledge gained through study, communication, research, or instruction. Essentially, information is the result of analyzing and interpreting pieces of data. Whereas data is the individual figures, numbers, or graphs, information is the perception of those pieces of knowledge.</p><p>For example, a set of data could include temperature readings in a location over several years. Without any additional context, those temperatures have no meaning. However, when you analyze and organize that information, you could determine seasonal temperature patterns or even broader climate trends. Only when the data is organized and compiled in a useful way can it provide information that is beneficial to others.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://bloomfire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Data-vs.-Information-Graphic-2-1168x657.png"></figure>";s:9:"view_post";s:3:"100";}}__ci_vars|a:2:{s:13:"_ci_old_input";s:3:"old";s:10:"successMsg";s:3:"old";}successMsg|a:1:{s:7:"success";s:37:"Cập nhật bài viết thành công";}
